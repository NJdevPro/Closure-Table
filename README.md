# Closure-Table
An implementation of the closure table pattern in Python + SQL

A closure table is a table that permits to represent hierarchical data in a SQL table and query them efficiently without having to create recursive queries.

See for instance: https://technobytz.com/closure_table_store_hierarchical_data.htmll

This particular program was written for use with SQLite but the SQL is standard and thus adaptation to other databases should be straightforward.
